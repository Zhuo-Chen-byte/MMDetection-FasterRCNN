# MMDetection-FasterRCNN
In addition to all files of a regular mmdetection project, this directory holds (*after you download them*):  
- Two pretrained PyTorch faster rcnn backbones (*faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.pth* and *faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_2x_coco.pth* under pretrained/)  
- The complete configuration to train a faster-rcnn model (*my_faster_rcnn.py* under configs/faster_rcnn)
